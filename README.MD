# Calculate Ï€

I wrote this program on 3/14/2021 to celebrate Pi DAY!!! 
I was partly inspired by jomatech (@jomaoppa) where in one of his videos he calculates the number Pi using a different method. [Here's the link to that video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvimAM_SLic)

## My approach/explanation to this question:
I use the concept of integral to achive this. 
I simply sum all of the "mini" rectangles under the circle and add them to a total sum/tally. As you can see in the picture below the red area will get smaller and while it gets smaller we add up all the rectangles up to till we reach 0.

Happy pi day!
